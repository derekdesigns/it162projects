<h2>Responsive Websites vs Mobile Apps</h2>
<p>My recent switch to an iPhone prompted an alarming discovery, and it had nothing to do with the ongoing battle of Apple vs Droid for mobile supremacy. One of the features of my new toy was an automatically generated weekly report of my screen time, and let me tell you it was far higher than I would have guessed.</p>
<p>My revelation, I’ve come to learn, was not unique. The average American spends 5.4 hours a day on his/her phone (Brown), and checks it over 60 times a day. This is not a generational issue either, as baby-boomers fall only slightly below millennials in usage. The convenience of one’s phone for the internet is an irreversible trend, so for me it’s not a matter of how responsive websites compare to mobile apps; the better question is how are mobile apps becoming more responsive?</p>
<p>Of course, a responsive website can offer things that an app cannot.  A website works on all devices, is easier to link to, and is usually less expensive to manage.  A smaller company also risks getting lost among the giants in an app store.  But there are several areas where apps display superiority.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages with mobile apps is speed. Since data is stored locally, as opposed to website data utilizing servers, information can be accessed an average of fifty percent faster (Mahajan). Agility is featured even more prominently when making purchases, as many apps have a one-click feature. They showcase other emerging technologies, like facial recognition and fingerprint detection, and are capitalizing on cutting-edge uses of cameras, scanners, and GPS.</p>
<p>Another leverage with mobile apps is branding, because customers are getting an interactive and personalized experience. Users can fashion preferences upon downloading, and subsequent engagement can easily be tracked.  Push notifications, an alert an app uses to convey a special offer or otherwise get a user’s attention, is crafty real time marketing.  If the solicitation is unwanted, one simple finger-stroke makes it go away, so it is unlikely to cause annoyance (unless overused) and far less intrusive than pop-up ads.</p>
