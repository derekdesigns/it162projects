<h2>Sliders</h2>
<p>The term sliders refers to rotating images on a website; a slideshow if you will.  As simple as that sounds, it is actually quite a divisive topic amongst web designers and developers.  There are those that love them, at least as many that hate them, and not too many people falling indifferently in between.</p>
<p><u>The case for sliders:</u>  They can drive home branding when chosen wisely, even solidifying in a user’s own mind that he/she has chosen the right site.  They consolidate space, and sometimes offer a welcome break before continuing to scroll down the page.  Also if you regularly update your site, sliders can help emphasize what’s new.</p>
<p><u>The case against sliders:</u>  “They are a good technique for getting useless information on a homepage. Use them to put content that users will ignore.” (Lee Duddell)  An attempt at branding backfires if the user assumes that all the rotating images mean that the company has no idea what they want to highlight.  A user may also equate them to a pop-up ad, in which case you have probably lost them.  Even if a user likes the pictures, they take attention away from everything else on the site.  Then from a technological perspective, sliders will sometimes slow down pages and may not translate well to mobile.</p>
<p><u>The most likely areas to incorporate:</u>  Assuming for a moment that you’re not in the ‘Don’t Ever Use’ camp, there are certain types of websites where a stronger case can be made that sliders may be integrated effectively.  Take a website that sells cars or homes for example.  These are huge purchases that potential buyers want to look at from every angle before investing the time to view in person.  A slider can then be an incredibly useful tool to quickly cover what you covet from all different angles.<p>
