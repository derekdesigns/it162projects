<h2>Shopping Carts</h2>
<p>As Silicon Valley was experiencing its first boom of the internet era in the mid 90s, a German software engineer named Stephan Schambach developed the first online shopping cart.  While he may not be a household name, do not fear that his invention went unrewarded; he has started several successful companies, one of which was acquired by Salesforce.  Consider him a prominent member of the Billionaires Club.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the modern era, and nobody would have any idea how to proceed with an online purchase without the shopping cart symbol as a guide.  But what is a shopping cart actually?  It is a piece of software that keeps a record of items chosen, and facilitates the payment for a product or service. This can be divided into two main types: hosted and licensed.</p>
<p>Hosted shopping carts refer to a third party processing the transaction.  This is usually the preferred method for a small business, because it’s low-cost.  The best known company for hosting is Shopify, with plans ranging from $9-299 per month.</p>
<p>Licensed shopping carts mean that you are hosting on your own server.  They are geared toward business owners that want to build, customize, and monitor the purchasing process themselves.  This tailored experience comes at quite a prohibitive cost for most businesses, easily reaching into the thousands of dollars of up-front costs along with higher monthly fees as well...</p>
<p>Shopping cart technology continues to be refined.  In the last few years much thought has been put to minimizing the dreaded abandoned shopping cart; a term for when a user chooses one or more items but does not follow through with the purchase.  Common causes include a checkout process that takes too long (especially if it involves creating an account), and unanticipated additional costs emerging that were not shown up front.</p>
