 <p>I'm excited to be a part of Seattle Central's Web Design Program. I returned to school last year, earning a certificate at North Seattle in Web Application Technologies. Prior to enrolling there, I really had no experience at all in IT (actually, I may not have known what IT stood for). So I'm vey grateful to now have at least a basic understanding of javascript, html, css, databases, networking, and troubleshooting. As valuable as it was to cover such a broad range of skills, the only class that I truly enjoyed was Web Authoring. That's what brings me here!</p>
 <p>I have worked in hospitality for over 25 years. It offered a decent living and forged many friendships, but crazy long hours and stress was creating major burnout.... COVID related unemployment gave me time to reflect on this, and alter my path. </p>
